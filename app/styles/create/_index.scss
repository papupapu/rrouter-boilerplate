/**
 * CSS Generation from Design Tokens
 * 
 * Phase 3: Proper CSS Code Splitting
 * 
 * This file imports ONLY critical CSS that will be inlined in <head>.
 * Non-critical CSS is imported separately in app/styles/non-critical-entry.scss
 * 
 * Result:
 * - This file → root-*.css (critical, inlined in <style> tag)
 * - non-critical-entry.scss → non-critical-*.css (external, lazy-loaded)
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Smaller initial page load (only critical CSS in <head>)
 * - Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
 * - Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP)
 * - No CSS duplication
