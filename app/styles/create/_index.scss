/**
 * CSS Generation from Design Tokens
 * 
 * Phase 3: Proper CSS Code Splitting
 * 
 * This file imports ONLY critical CSS that will be inlined in <head>.
 * Non-critical CSS is imported separately in app/styles/non-critical-entry.scss
 * 
 * In PRODUCTION BUILD:
 * - This file → root-*.css (critical, inlined in <style> tag)
 * - non-critical-entry.scss → non-critical-*.css (external, lazy-loaded)
 * - css-compiled-separately plugin handles the separate compilation
 * 
 * In DEVELOPMENT MODE:
 * - Both entry points are compiled by Vite's dev server
 * - Vite automatically includes both via optimizeDeps
 * - HMR handles instant updates for both
 * 
 * Result:
 * - Dev: All styles available for rapid development (via dual entry points)
 * - Prod: Optimized split (critical inline, non-critical async)
 * - No CSS duplication in either mode
