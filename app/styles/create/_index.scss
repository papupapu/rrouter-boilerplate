/**
 * CSS Utility Class Generators
 * 
 * Phase 4: Auto-Import Abstracts & Reorganize Critical CSS
 * 
 * This file generates utility classes from design tokens.
 * Design token imports are now handled automatically by:
 * - app/styles/index.scss → imports from .internal/critical-css/generated-critical
 * - app/styles/non-critical-entry.scss → imports from .internal/critical-css/generated-non-critical
 * 
 * This file ONLY generates utility classes that are used by both critical and non-critical CSS:
 * - .c-txt-* (color text utilities)
 * - .c-bg-* (color background utilities)
 * - .tp-w-* (typography weight utilities)
 * - .tp-s-* (typography size utilities)
 * - Flex utilities
 * - Spacing utilities
 * - etc.
