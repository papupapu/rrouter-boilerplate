/**
 * Non-Critical CSS Entry Point (Phase 4)
 * 
 * This is a separate SCSS entry point that compiles ONLY non-critical CSS.
 * During build, Vite will create a separate non-critical-*.css bundle from this file.
 * 
 * In the Vite build:
 * - app/styles/index.scss → root-*.css (critical CSS, inlined in <head>)
 * - app/styles/non-critical-entry.scss → non-critical-*.css (async-loaded)
 * 
 * The beasties-processor will:
 * 1. Inline root-*.css as <style id="critical-css"> tag
 * 2. Add non-critical-*.css as <link rel="stylesheet"> tag with lazy-loading
 * 
 * NOTE: Abstracts and utility generators are in critical CSS only, so all CSS variables
 * and utility classes are available globally once critical CSS loads.
